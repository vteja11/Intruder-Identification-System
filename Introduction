Identifying and catching intruders has become a difficult task as intruders/thieves found intelligent ways to tackle techniques used to catch them

New ways are introduced to identify the intruder and alert owner/administrator. Five different ways to catch intruder/thief via “a message (SMS)”, “WhatsApp message”, “location of intruder”, “an immediate call”, “and Intruder’s image to owner’s /administrator’s WhatsApp”

Mainly discusses, how face recognition is used to detect intruders/thieves. All the familiar and known faces are trained first. If unknown face is detected, then owner/administrator is alerted. Machine learning is used for facial identification. Facial images of familiar persons are captured in every angle, to recognize familiar persons in any angle

The main purpose is to discuss, how to identify the intruder and alert owner/administrator. Intruders are mostly the ones, who doesn’t belong to same locality/doesn’t belong to same institution
