Security has become an important factor. Intruders have become prominent factors for all the data/property theft.
 
The basic idea of this project is to identify the intruder and alerting owner/administrator in different possible ways.
 
In this Project we  discusses different ways such as “a message (SMS)”, “WhatsApp message”, “location of intruder”, “an immediate call”, “intruder’s image to owner’s/administrator’s WhatsApp” to alert owner/administrator. .
