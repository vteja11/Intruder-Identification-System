First step in the process is to scan the faces of all  known members of the vicinity. Each person willhave a name and a unique ID number. He/She shall enter her details. After registering each person, training him/her is done. Every time this process is continued.

The next step is the recognition. This whole process of the scanning, training, recognition made possible through GUI.
 
Later the implementation code is dumped into raspberry-pi, so-that it becomes a real time system.

For scanning, training & recognizing machine learning is used. Algorithm named as Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH)[for recognition], haarcascades [for detection] are used

If an intruder is detected, automatically “a message (SMS)”, “WhatsApp message”, “location of intruder”, “an immediate call”, “intruder’s image to owner’s/administrator’s WhatsApp” are sent to owner/administrator.    
The messaging/calling service is done by importing the TWILIO[14] library. TWILIO is a cloud platform for sending trial messages and calling services. It provides 5 trial messages and calls per day
